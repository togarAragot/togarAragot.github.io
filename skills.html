            <p>
                Maybe this isn't what you have expected since Java isn't typically used to code Discord bots, but it is possible, and I was and still am pretty interested in doing so.
                My very first project was a ticket bot, which worked out better than expected. However, I couldn't really use it for my own purposes due to privacy concerns.
                As you might know Discord is a messenger and saving those messages without encrypting their content is not good. At that time I only learned to code Discord bots in order to learn Java and not encryption.
                Thus, I just scrapped the idea of having an own ticket bot and started working on a much larger project. This time I was experienced and knew more Java than ever.
                I continued my journey and developed a moderation bot to watch over and ban users across multiple servers. This bot was a huge success, which in the end
                moderated over 25 different servers featuring over 10K different users. Once I was satisfied with the moderation bot I started developing the next Discord bot, which
                was initially just made for funny commands but later evolved into a Bot with multiple mini-games, an inventory system, some gambling aspects and authentic giveaways.
                Sure this bot was never used by any big servers but my own small server with about 1K Members was more than enough, and the result was way better than my expectations.

            <h4>Minecraft</h4>
            <p>
                This has to be my most passionate project, and I am proud to talk about it. I've been playing Minecraft for a few years now and In the past 2-3 years I have
                also started to code with it. I coded a few things, which include different plugins for servers, scripts with a another scripting language and modifications (this is where I had the most fun with).
                Most people would think that I coded custom items or blocks or something similar but no. I was not interested in that kind of stuff.
                I was most interested in security related stuff such as packet handling and manipulating. This is also what made me a good exploiter on several servers.
                I hung out in communities that were dedicated to finding bugs and glitches across different servers. I created my own tool to mess with everything the game had to offer.
                With that I was able to code multiple DOS-Modules into my mod. DOS-Modules most of the time were pretty straight forward.
                Some of them were scripts, which just did one action over and over again. Some others had malicious packets which just caused severe lag.
                I am pretty sure I caused some trouble to those servers but in the end they were always able to patch the bugs I've found.
                Packet manipulation in general is pretty fun and interesting. It doesn't matter that much if it's just spamming, changing values, delaying or simply not sending
                specific packets. It's always been a fun way to mess around.

                This is the career I am seeking currently. I've recently started with it, but I already learned so much about this. This is probably the most interesting
                branch of development that I've dealt with so far. Even though I just started about 6 months ago, I already learned how to code plugins for several system such as Wordpress
                and Moodle. Due to my previous programming knowledge I feel very comfortable with the common web development languages. I am currently learning the frontend development
                as I've already learned quite a lot about the backend and my mission is to become a fullstack developer at some point.
